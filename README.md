# Purpose
This repostory contains material for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course at the Indian Statistical Instutute, Bangalore
# Textbook and References
* I will follow for the most part the sequence in this book by Sedgewick https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/ . You can use this online
material to support what is taught in class.
* Other references will be mentioned as and when required.
# Content:
Not fully though out, but here is an outline (WIP). The sections mentioned are with respect to the textbook by Sedgewick.
* **Introduction** Notion of Analysis through examples - Insertion sort, selection sort, search, binary search, Algorithm complexity vs problem complexity, space versus time complexity., what is the parameter in the compexity function. Introducing the Big Oh (and Big Theta and Big Omega) concepts for characterizing complexity. Binary search vs Fibonacci search. Examples with bitwize add and multiply. Fast bitwise multiply. Recurrence relations and the Master Theorem.
* **Sorting**  Merge sort, heap-sort, 
* **Searching**

# Lecture sequencing
* 23-July-24  Introduction section, up to space vs time complexity.
* 25-July-24  Formal complexity notation, bitwize operations.
* 30-July-24  Faster multiply, the Master theorem and revisitng binary search and outline of merge sort. Introduction to heaps.
